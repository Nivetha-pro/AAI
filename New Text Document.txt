## **I. INTRODUCTION**  
Gaussian Processes (GPs) are a powerful probabilistic model used for regression, classification, and predictive tasks. They model complex, non-linear relationships and provide probabilistic predictions. This study implements Gaussian Process Classifiers (GPC) with Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernels on dementia and Parkinsonâ€™s datasets. The goal is to evaluate GPC performance across probabilistic metrics and analyze kernel influence on model parameters.

## **III. GAUSSIAN PROCESS CLASSIFIER (GPC)**  
### **A. Definition**  
GPC is a machine learning model used for classification tasks, particularly effective in medical diagnosis due to its ability to quantify uncertainty in predictions.  
  
### **B. Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel**  
- Enables flexible decision boundaries.  
- Handles non-linear relationships effectively.  
- Provides probabilistic class predictions with uncertainty measures.  
  
### **C. K-Fold Cross-Validation (K=5)**

- Training and testing occurred over 5 iterations.  
- This approach ensured a reliable model evaluation.

## **IV. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS**  
### **A. Continuous vs Discrete Methods**  
- Discrete methods oversimplified complex datasets and struggled with continuous features.  
- Continuous models (GP) excelled in handling clinical metrics and provided better decision boundaries.  
  
### **B. Bayesian Networks in Medical Diagnosis**  
- **Score-Based Algorithms** (e.g., Hill Climbing) outperformed other approaches in flexible structure learning.  
- **Constraint-Based and Hybrid Approaches** were less effective in handling continuous data.  
  
### **C. Implementation Comparisons**  
- **Scikit-Learn**: Effective for small datasets, high flexibility.  
- **GPy**: Better performance for large continuous datasets due to automatic differentiation.  
  
### **D. Kernel Influence on GPC**  
- The RBF kernel effectively handled complex, non-linear relationships.  
- Provided an advantage over discrete classification methods.

## **VI. CONCLUSION**  
This study demonstrates the effectiveness of Gaussian Process Classifiers (GPC) in diagnosing Dementia and Parkinsonâ€™s disease. The results show that continuous models significantly outperform discrete models in classification accuracy and flexibility. The use of the RBF kernel enhances the modelâ€™s ability to capture complex, non-linear patterns, making it a powerful tool for medical diagnosis. Additionally, the comparative analysis between Scikit-learn and GPy highlights their respective advantages, with Scikit-learn excelling in small-scale applications and GPy offering superior performance on large datasets. 

K-fold cross-validation was instrumental in ensuring a robust evaluation, reducing overfitting, and improving generalization. The ability of GPC to quantify prediction uncertainty is crucial in medical applications where confidence in diagnosis is as important as accuracy. 

### **Future Work**  
- Investigate alternative kernel functions such as MatÃ©rn or Periodic kernels for improved performance.  
- Apply deep learning-based probabilistic models to enhance classification accuracy.  
- Expand dataset size to improve model generalization and robustness.
